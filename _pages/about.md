Hi, Emeline there 👋
======

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Gro Intelligence where I predict the impact of climate change on global food supplies, 
informing strategies to mitigate risks and ensure food availability for all.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning from Ensimag, France. 
I studied Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, USA as part of a Graduate Exchange Program.

Through my work in time series forecasting and machine learning, 
I'm dedicated to contributing to a world where AI solutions drive positive social changes.

My Experience 
======

🌾 Senior Data Scientist @ Gro Intelligence (New York, USA)
