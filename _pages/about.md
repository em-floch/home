Hi, Emeline there
======

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Gro Intelligence. I build predictive models to inform how climate impacts food 
supplies globally and flag risks of food insecurity. 

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning from Grenoble Institute of Technology, France. 
I studied Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, USA as part of a Graduate Exchange Program.

I'm determined to use my analytical skills to support positive change in everyday lives.
