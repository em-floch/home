## About me

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Gro Intelligence](https://www.gro-intelligence.com/) where I forecast the impact of climate change on global food supplies, 
informing strategies to mitigate risks and ensure food availability for all.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning from Ensimag, France. 
I studied Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, USA as part of a Graduate Exchange Program.

Through my work in Machine Learning and Time Series forecasting, 
my goal is to build AI solutions that drive positive societal change. 

## Personal Projects and Curiosities
